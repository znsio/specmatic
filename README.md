##### Transform your API Specifications into Executable Contracts with #NoCode in Seconds
Experience the power of Contract-Driven Development to confidently develop and independently deploy your Microservices and Microfrontends faster.

### Context

In a complex, interdependent ecosystem, where each service is evolving rapidly, we want to make the dependencies between them explicit in the form of executable contracts. [Contract Driven Development](https://specmatic.io/contract_driven_development.html) leverages API specifications like [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/#openapi-specification), [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) SDL files, [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) Proto files, etc. as executable contracts allowing teams to get instantaneous feedback while making changes to avoid accidental breakage.

With this ability, we can now independently deploy, at will, any service at any time without having to depend on expensive and fragile integration tests.
